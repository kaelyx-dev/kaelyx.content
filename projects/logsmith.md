LogSmith looks to be a source of logs, why just generate logs for the sake of it?
I am in the process of developing a FOSS Log Viewer, and I need a consistent way to generate logs of different types and shapes to help me test this log viewer and ensure the log viewer's parser is working correctly and handling all cases that are provided to it.
