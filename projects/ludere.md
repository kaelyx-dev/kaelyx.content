Streamers now-listening widgets to notify their stream of what they are currently listening to, this ability can often be provided by a freemium service provider, this project allows them to run this feature as an app alongside them streaming.
This app allows them to control their own integration via creating a spotify application and self-hosting it on their own machine. This works via the app hosting a webserver which is communicating with the App to get what the user is currently listening to. This is then displayed in the page which can then be set as a source in the streaming tool such as OBS.
