# Ai and its collapse towards GPTS

In this post, I am going to cover my observations on the commodification and mass exposure of GPT models and how other impressive models and paradigms are left in the dark.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its collapse towards Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), Its not all LLMs.

### GPTs are not smart. They are parrots, parrots who have read the entire internet, and then some.

## Novel approaches and The Wall(tm)

## Machine Learning - Its ML not AI.

## Business Use - FOMO is not a business strategy.

## You're using it to do what?! Hallucionations and Inaccuracy.

## SISO - Its an acronym - google the dead internet theory.
