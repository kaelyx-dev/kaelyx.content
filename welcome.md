# üëã Hi! Im Kaelyx

I'm a software developer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, passionate about crafting open-source tools and pieces of work. My mission is to enhance the development workflow by creating cool tools that other people (might) use.
By Day, I am a professional working in Java, JavaScript, PHP or Sass. Whether that be Vue, Play, Magento 2 or even  Wordpress...<br>
By Night, I experiment and explore with different projects and technologies, be Hardware or software. Creating cool or fun tools and projects to share with the world (or just a discord group chat).<br>

Feel free to checkout my {{link link=https://github.com/kaelyx-dev name=Github}} where I store most of my projects, even the ones I wish I could forget about. I also have small project writeups in my {{link link=/projects/README.md name=Projects}} directory if you fancy an explore. I also occasionally ramble about what I have created, seen or experienced on this small rock floating in space, check them out in my {{link link=/blog/README.md name=Blog}}.

Explore this portfolio website till your heart is content. This portfolio website was a cool project in itself. Hosted entirely via Github and Github pages, this dynamic content website uses two repositories, one for the site and one for the content! Everything from the footer content to the navigation is configurable, on a statically hosted site!!
