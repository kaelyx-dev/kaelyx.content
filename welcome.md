# Hi! Im Kaelyx -- A Software developer and Enthusiast from Newcastle!

Welcome to my portfolio and blog site where I share my current ongoings and explorations.

By Day, I am a professional working in Java, JavaScript and PHP. Whether that be Vue, Play, Magento 2 or even  Wordpress...<br>
By Night, I experiment and explore with different projects and technologies, be Hardware or software. <br>

Take a look around! This website is 100% static but still allows me to update its content and config dynamically by utilising a Github repo for the site which pulls from another github repo for content!

{{link link="/blog/README.md",name="Blog"}} for my outer ramblings <br>
{{link link="/projects/README.md",name="Projects"}} for what ive managed to cobble together into somehwat cohesive projects.
